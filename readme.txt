Adds an alert message or countdown timer to your site's front end, anywhere within the site layout

== Description ==

The alert is quickly styled and placed on your site, and easily closed by your site visitors should they choose to dismiss it.

= Styling =

You can customize the look of your alert message in a few ways.

* Use a simple color picker to select text and background colors for the message (no coding necessary)
* Add additional CSS in the plugin options if needed

= Placement =

You can specify where the alert should go within your site layout.

* Use any unique CSS-style selector (e.g. #my-div) to choose where to insert the message, or leave this blank to insert at the top of your site's body
* Choose to insert the alert message either before or after your chosen page element (default is before)

= Locations =

The plugin gives you several choices as to which screens should show your message.

* Show on all pages
* Show on the home page (whether it be a page or your recent posts)
* Show for only certain page/post ID's

= Countdown Timer =

Currently the countdown timer displays a simple day countdown as a shortcode, and you need to create your own context around the displayed number.

== Installation ==

* Go To Plugins >> Add New
* Either search for "Big Boom" or Upload the .zip file downloaded here.
* Once installed, go to the `Settings > Alerts & Messages` admin menu item and choose your settings.
* You can use the plugin settings to determine which pages the alerts show, or you can use the shortcode [alm_alert] within a page or post.
